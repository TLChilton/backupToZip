# backupToZip
A simple command line zip and unzip program using python. 
Based on code from "Automate the Boring Stuff With Python" by Al Sweigart

## Usage
To use the .bat file command line functionality you will need to add the folder you have it in to your "Path" environment variable.

Commands:
tzip                     - displays usage information
tzip [folder name]       - compresses that folder
tzip unzip [folder name] - unzips that folder

## What I added
* Added command line functionality via .bat file
* Added error checking for nonexistent folder names
* Added functionality for unzipping files (Sweigart's only had zipping mechanisms
